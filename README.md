# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This application was made so that you can create, edit, and store daily events that need to be tracked. The time block that matches the current hour of your day will be highlighted as red. Anything from earlier in your day will be grayed out and things yet to come will be in green. AS you enter and save information, the data will be stored locally until the next day at which time the stored data will be cleared and ready for new information to be entered.
